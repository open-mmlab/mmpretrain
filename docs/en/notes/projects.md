# Projects

We list some open-source projects built on MMClassification. They are good examples of how to use MMClassification as a library, to help your own projects.

- [OpenMixup](https://github.com/Westlake-AI/openmixup): an open-source toolbox for supervised, self-, and semi-supervised visual representation learning with mixup based on PyTorch, especially for mixup-related methods.
- [Involution](https://github.com/d-li14/involution): Inverting the Inherence of Convolution for Visual Recognition, a brand new neural operator.
- [AI Power](https://github.com/ykk648/AI_power): AI toolbox and pretrain models.
- [OpenBioSeq](https://github.com/Westlake-AI/OpenBioSeq): an open-source supervised and self-supervised bio-sequence representation learning toolbox based on PyTorch.

If you use MMClassification for open-source projects, welcome to update your projects in current page.
