## Introduction

English | [ÁÆÄ‰Ωì‰∏≠Êñá](/README_zh-CN.md)

MMClassification is an open source image classification toolbox based on PyTorch. It is
a part of the [OpenMMLab](https://openmmlab.com/) project.

The `1.x` branch works with **PyTorch 1.6+**.

### Major features

- Various backbones and pretrained models
- Bag of training tricks
- Large-scale training configs
- High efficiency and extensibility
- Powerful toolkits

## What's new

v1.0.0rc5 was released in 30/12/2022

- Support **EVA**, **RevViT**, **EfficientnetV2**, **CLIP**, **TinyViT** and **MixMIM** backbones.
- Reproduce the training accuracy of **ConvNeXt** and **RepVGG**.
- Support **multi-task** training and testing. See [#1229](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification/pull/1229) for more details.
- Support Test-time Augmentation. See [#1161](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification/pull/1161) for
  more details.

v1.0.0rc4 was released in 06/12/2022.

- Upgrade API to get pre-defined models of MMClassification. See [#1236](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification/pull/1236) for more details.
- Refactor BEiT backbone and support v1/v2 inference. See [#1144](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification/pull/1144).

v1.0.0rc3 was released in 21/11/2022.

- Add **Switch Recipe** Hook, Now we can modify training pipeline, mixup and loss settings during training, see [#1101](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification/pull/1101).
- Add **TIMM and HuggingFace** wrappers. Now you can train/use models in TIMM/HuggingFace directly, see [#1102](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification/pull/1102).
- Support **retrieval tasks**, see [#1055](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification/pull/1055).
- Reproduce **mobileone** training accuracy. See [#1191](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification/pull/1191)

This release introduced a brand new and flexible training & test engine, but it's still in progress. Welcome
to try according to [the documentation](https://mmclassification.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/).

And there are some BC-breaking changes. Please check [the migration tutorial](https://mmclassification.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/migration.html).

The release candidate will last until the end of 2022, and during the release candidate, we will develop on the `1.x` branch. And we will still maintain 0.x version still at least the end of 2023.

Please refer to [changelog.md](https://mmclassification.readthedocs.io/en/1.x/notes/changelog.html) for more details and other release history.

## Installation

Below are quick steps for installation:

```shell
conda create -n open-mmlab python=3.8 pytorch==1.10.1 torchvision==0.11.2 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch -y
conda activate open-mmlab
pip install openmim
git clone -b 1.x https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmclassification.git
