## Abstract

We introduce the Segment Anything (SA) project: a new task, model, and dataset for image segmentation. Using our efficient model in a data collection loop, we built the largest segmentation dataset to date (by far), with over 1 billionmasks on 11M licensed and privacy respecting images. The model is designed and trained to be promptable, so it can transfer zero-shot to new image distributions and tasks. We evaluate its capabilities on numerous tasks and find that its zero-shot performance is impressive â€“ often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised results. We are releasing the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and corresponding dataset (SA-1B) of 1B masks and 11M images at https://segment-anything.com to foster research into foundation models for computer vision.

## How to use it?

<!-- [TABS-BEGIN] -->

**Use the model**

```python
import torch
from mmpretrain import get_model

model = get_model('vit-base-p16_sam-pre_3rdparty_sa1b-1024px', pretrained=True)
inputs = torch.rand(1, 3, 1024, 1024)
out = model(inputs)
print(type(out))
# To extract features.
feats = model.extract_feat(inputs)
print(type(feats))
```
