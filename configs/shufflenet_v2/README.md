## Abstract

Currently, the neural network architecture design is mostly guided by the *indirect* metric of computation complexity, i.e., FLOPs. However, the *direct* metric, e.g., speed, also depends on the other factors such as memory access cost and platform characterics. Thus, this work proposes to evaluate the direct metric on the target platform, beyond only considering FLOPs. Based on a series of controlled experiments, this work derives several practical *guidelines* for efficient network design. Accordingly, a new architecture is presented, called *ShuffleNet V2*. Comprehensive ablation experiments verify that our model is the state-of-the-art in terms of speed and accuracy tradeoff.
